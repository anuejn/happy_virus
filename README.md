A rounded font with no enclosed whitespace.

# About
Created during a typography workshop of my university I created this font drawing inspiration from the song "happy virus" by Hundreds.
The font only lowercase letters and fits perfectly into the seemingly perfect plastic-world described in the lyrics of the song.

The glyphs were designed in inkscape and assembled to a font with a python script using fontforge. Manual tweaks and keringn in fontforge followed.  

## Example
